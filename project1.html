        <h1>Edge-Based Traffic Monitoring System Using Computer Vision</h1>

        <ul>
        <li>
            Developed an end-to-end computer vision pipeline in <strong>Python</strong>, integrating 
            <strong>YOLOv11</strong>, <strong>BoT SORT</strong>, and directional counting across 
            12 movement patterns for road intersections, achieving an <strong>mAP-50 of 0.931</strong> 
            and <strong>F1-score of 0.893</strong> on a custom dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
            Collected and annotated traffic footage from Manila, performing data augmentation to 
            enhance detection robustness across five localized vehicle classes 
            (Jeepney, Motorcycle, Passenger Car, Tricycle, Truck).
        </li>
        <li>
            Built a graphical user interface (GUI) using <strong>Tkinter</strong> and deployed the optimized 
            model on an <strong>NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano</strong>, enabling real-time, scalable traffic monitoring 
            to support flow analysis and urban transport planning.
        </li>
