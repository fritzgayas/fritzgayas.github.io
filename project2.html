        <ul>
        <li>
            Co-developed an inventory monitoring system by programming the 
            <strong>ATMega328P microcontroller</strong> using Arduino IDE and integrating it with 
            the <strong>Loyverse API</strong> to automate QR code generation, scanning, and 
            synchronization with a cloud-based database.
        </li>
        <li>
            Designed the circuit schematic and PCB layout using <strong>EasyEDA</strong>, and fabricated 
            the custom PCB via <strong>JLCPCB</strong>, ensuring reliable hardware performance and 
            seamless integration with embedded components.
        </li>
        <li>
            Delivered a scalable solution for a food franchise client, improving inventory transparency, 
            branch coordination, and operational scalability across commissary and franchise locations 
            through <strong>three Flutter-based mobile applications</strong>.
